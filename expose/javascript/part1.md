Question 1) Since we're only calling the function once with values 10,10 line 9 will print "values added: 20"
Question 2) This line will output "final result: 20"
Question 3) This line outputs "Values added: 20"
Question 4) This line returns an error because the variable is only declared in the if statement and since we used let to declare the var line 13 has no access to the var "result"
Question 5) this line never gets executed since the line where we add the values tries to reassign a const variable throws an error because you cannot reassign a const var.
Question 6) this line never gets executed since the line where we add the values tries to reassign a const variable throws an error because you cannot reassign a const var.
